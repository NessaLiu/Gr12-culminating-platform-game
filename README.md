### Gr. 12 Computer Science: SUMMER SHOWDOWN PLATFORM GAME

ICS4U - Grade 12 Computer Science Culminating Project
- ICS4U Culminating Project - Self Study Unit
- Date: June 2021
- Purpose: Create a platform game using Python and Pygame

For the final culminating assignment for ICS4U Grade 12 Computer Science, we were given the task to study independently and be creative with developing a small project. Whether it be a website, app, browser extension, or game, we were free to explore any area that blossomed interest. Hence, to compliment my love for games, I decided to research PyGame and the various possibilities of entertainment forms I could create. I ended up choosing to code a single-player platform game with a scrolling background, influenced by the nostalgic games I used to play in my childhood. This "Summer Showdown" game uses object-oriented programming to implement running and jumping, a level system, health status, item collection, music and sound effects. There were also enemy AI which the user could attack and also receive damage from. It was a great learning experience and being able to successfully produce a functioning game was extremely rewarding!
